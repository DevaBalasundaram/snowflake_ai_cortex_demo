# Best Practices for Snowflake Cortex Analyst

This guide provides production-ready best practices for implementing Snowflake Cortex Analyst in your organization.

## üéØ Semantic Model Design

### Start Simple, Scale Gradually
- Begin with 2-3 core tables that answer 80% of business questions
- Add complexity incrementally based on user feedback
- Test extensively with real users before expanding

### Business-Focused Naming
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good - Business terms
- name: monthly_revenue
  description: "Total monthly sales revenue"
  synonyms: ["sales", "income", "monthly sales"]

# ‚ùå Avoid - Technical column names  
- name: rev_amt_sum
  description: "Revenue amount sum"
```

### Rich Descriptions and Synonyms
```yaml
measures:
  - name: customer_acquisition_cost
    expr: marketing_spend / new_customers
    description: "Cost to acquire each new customer (CAC) - marketing spend divided by new customers acquired"
    synonyms: ["CAC", "acquisition cost", "cost per customer", "customer cost"]
    data_type: number
```

### Sample Values for Better Context
```yaml
dimensions:
  - name: product_category
    expr: category
    description: "Primary product category"
    sample_values: ["Electronics", "Clothing", "Home & Garden", "Sports"]
    data_type: varchar
```

## üîí Security & Governance

### Role-Based Access Control
```sql
-- Create dedicated roles for different user groups
CREATE ROLE cortex_business_users;
CREATE ROLE cortex_analysts;  
CREATE ROLE cortex_admins;

-- Grant appropriate Cortex permissions
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_business_users;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_analysts;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE cortex_admins;

-- Limit data access using views
CREATE SECURE VIEW public_revenue_data AS 
SELECT date, revenue, product_line, region 
FROM detailed_revenue_data
WHERE is_public = TRUE;
```

### Data Masking for Sensitive Fields
```sql
-- Create masking policy for PII
CREATE MASKING POLICY customer_name_mask AS (val string) RETURNS string ->
  CASE 
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ANALYSTS', 'ADMINS') THEN val
    ELSE '***MASKED***'
  END;

-- Apply to semantic model base tables
ALTER TABLE customer_data MODIFY COLUMN customer_name 
SET MASKING POLICY customer_name_mask;
```

### Audit and Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor Cortex usage
CREATE VIEW cortex_usage_monitoring AS
SELECT 
  user_name,
  query_text,
  start_time,
  credits_used,
  execution_status
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_text LIKE '%CORTEX.ANALYST%'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Warehouse Sizing
```sql
-- Small warehouses are optimal for LLM functions
CREATE WAREHOUSE cortex_wh 
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'           -- Don't use larger sizes
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60                  -- Suspend quickly
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;

-- For heavy analytics workloads, use separate warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 300;
```

### Query Result Caching
```sql
-- Enable result caching to reduce costs
ALTER WAREHOUSE cortex_wh SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;

-- Use materialized views for common aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_revenue_summary AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', date) as month,
  product_line,
  region,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
  AVG(revenue) as avg_daily_revenue
FROM daily_revenue_facts 
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3;
```

### Search Service Optimization
```sql
-- Create targeted search services
CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE product_search
ON product_dim
WAREHOUSE = cortex_wh
TARGET_LAG = '6 hours'        -- Less frequent refresh for stable data
AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    product_name,
    product_category,
    brand
  FROM product_dim
  WHERE is_active = TRUE
);
```

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Resource Monitoring
```sql
-- Set up resource monitors
CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR cortex_monthly_budget
  CREDIT_QUOTA = 100            -- Set appropriate limit
  FREQUENCY = MONTHLY
  START_TIMESTAMP = IMMEDIATELY
  TRIGGERS 
    ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
    ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
    ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

-- Apply to Cortex warehouses
ALTER WAREHOUSE cortex_wh SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = cortex_monthly_budget;
```

### Usage Analytics
```sql
-- Track Cortex costs by user/department
CREATE VIEW cortex_cost_analysis AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', start_time) as usage_date,
  user_name,
  database_name,
  COUNT(*) as query_count,
  SUM(credits_used_cloud_services) as cortex_credits,
  AVG(execution_time_millis) as avg_execution_time
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE query_text LIKE '%CORTEX.ANALYST%'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD(month, -1, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY cortex_credits DESC;
```

## üéì User Training & Adoption

### Question Templates
Provide users with effective question patterns:

**Good Questions:**
```
‚úÖ "What was our revenue in the Electronics category last quarter?"
‚úÖ "Show me the top 5 sales regions by profit margin"  
‚úÖ "Compare Q1 vs Q2 revenue by product line"
‚úÖ "Which customers have the highest lifetime value?"
```

**Questions to Improve:**
```
‚ùå "Show me some data" ‚Üí "Show me monthly revenue trends"
‚ùå "What happened?" ‚Üí "What caused the revenue drop in March?"
‚ùå "Everything about sales" ‚Üí "Compare sales performance by region"
```

### Progressive Disclosure
Start users with simple questions, then introduce complexity:

**Level 1 - Basic Aggregations:**
- "What was total revenue last month?"
- "How many orders did we have yesterday?"

**Level 2 - Comparisons:**  
- "Compare this quarter vs last quarter revenue"
- "Which product line grew the most?"

**Level 3 - Complex Analysis:**
- "Show cohort retention rates by acquisition channel"
- "Calculate customer lifetime value by segment"

## üîß Implementation Patterns

```

### Version Control
```yaml
# Include version metadata in semantic models
name: "Sales Analytics v2.1"
description: "Core sales and revenue analytics semantic model"
version: "2.1.0"
last_updated: "2025-08-18"
created_by: "Data Team"
approved_by: "Business Stakeholder"

# Track changes in commit messages
# git commit -m "feat: add customer lifetime value calculations to sales model v2.1"
```

### Testing Strategy
```sql
-- Create test suite for semantic models
CREATE SCHEMA cortex_testing;

-- Test data validation
CREATE TABLE test_scenarios (
  scenario_name STRING,
  test_question STRING,
  expected_sql_pattern STRING,
  expected_result_count INT,
  test_status STRING
);

-- Example test cases
INSERT INTO test_scenarios VALUES
  ('revenue_aggregation', 'What was total revenue last month?', '%SUM(revenue)%', NULL, 'pending'),
  ('product_filtering', 'Show me Electronics revenue', '%product_line%Electronics%', NULL, 'pending'),
  ('time_grouping', 'Monthly revenue trends', '%DATE_TRUNC%MONTH%', 12, 'pending');
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Success Metrics
Track these KPIs to measure Cortex Analyst adoption:

- **Usage Metrics:**
  - Daily/monthly active users
  - Questions asked per user per day
  - Query success rate

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Time to insight (compared to traditional BI)
  - Self-service query ratio
  - Data team request reduction

- **Quality Metrics:**
  - Query accuracy feedback
  - User satisfaction scores  
  - SQL query execution success rate

### Dashboard Creation
```sql
-- Create monitoring dashboard data
CREATE VIEW cortex_adoption_dashboard AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('week', start_time) as week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_name) as active_users,
  COUNT(*) as total_queries,
  AVG(execution_time_millis/1000) as avg_response_time,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN execution_status = 'SUCCESS' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as success_rate
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY  
WHERE query_text LIKE '%CORTEX.ANALYST%'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Semantic model not found"**
```sql
-- Check stage contents and permissions
LIST @your_stage;
SHOW GRANTS ON STAGE your_stage;

-- Verify file path format
-- ‚úÖ Correct: @database.schema.stage/file.yaml
-- ‚ùå Wrong: @stage/file.yaml (missing database.schema)
```

**Issue: "Poor query accuracy"**  
- Add more descriptive field descriptions
- Include business synonyms for technical terms
- Add sample values to dimension fields
- Create verified queries for common patterns

**Issue: "High token costs"**
- Use smaller warehouses (SMALL is optimal)
- Optimize semantic model complexity
- Set resource monitors and alerts
- Cache common query results

**Issue: "Slow response times"**
- Check warehouse auto-suspend settings
- Verify search services are running
- Optimize base table performance
- Review query complexity

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Custom Instructions
```yaml
# Add custom instructions to semantic model
custom_instructions: |
  When users ask about revenue, always include profit margins in the analysis.
  For time-based questions, default to the last complete month unless specified.
  When comparing periods, show percentage change calculations.
  Always format currency values with appropriate symbols.
```

### Multi-Model Architecture
```python
# Route questions to appropriate semantic models
def get_semantic_model(question: str) -> str:
    if any(word in question.lower() for word in ['customer', 'retention', 'churn']):
        return '@customer_analytics.yaml'
    elif any(word in question.lower() for word in ['campaign', 'marketing', 'lead']):
        return '@marketing_analytics.yaml'  
    else:
        return '@sales_analytics.yaml'
```
