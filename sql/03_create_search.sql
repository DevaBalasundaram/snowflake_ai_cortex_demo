Create Cortex Search Service

Cortex Search helps improve literal string searches to help Cortex Analyst 
generate more accurate SQL queries. When users ask questions that require 
filtering on exact values, the search service can help find the correct 
literals even if they don't match exactly.

For example:
User asks: "Show me revenue for electronics"  
Search service helps match "electronics" to "Electronics" in the data

Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Next Steps:
1. Upload revenue_timeseries.yaml to @raw_data stage
2. Create Streamlit app with cortex_analyst_demo.py  
3. Start asking natural language questions!

Sample questions to try:
- "What questions can I ask?"
- "What was our total revenue last month?"
- "Which product line has the highest profit margin?" 
- "Show me revenue trends by region"
- "Compare actual vs forecasted revenue"
